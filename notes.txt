This command creates the files for a basic web app project, along with a C# project file named [FolderName].csproj.

    dotnet new webapp -f net6.0

Run and build with:
    dotnet run
    
    * Locates the project file at the current directory.
    * Retrieves and installs any required project dependencies for this project.
    * Compiles the project code.
    * Hosts the web app with ASP.NET Core's Kestrel web server at both an HTTP and HTTPS endpoint.


Add razor pages

    dotnet new page --name "Page_name" --namespace projectID.Pages --output Pages

    * The preceding Razor page contains reserved Razor keywords:
    * The @page directive is what makes the page a Razor page. It indicates the page can handle HTTP requests. The @page directive must be the first directive on a Razor page.
    * The @model directive specifies the model type made available to the Razor page. In this case, the type is the PageModel-derived class name, prefixed with its namespace. As you recall, that class is defined in Pages/Item.cshtml.cs.
